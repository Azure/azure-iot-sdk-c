# Microsoft Azure IoT Device Provisioning Service SDK for C

## End of active development for service SDK

The Azure IoT Device Provisioning Service SDK for C is no longer under active development.

We will continue to fix critical bugs such as crashes, data corruption, and security vulnerabilities.  We will **NOT** add any new feature or fix bugs that are not critical, however.

Azure IoT Service SDK support is available in higher-level languages ([C#](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp), [Java](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-java), [Node](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-node), [Python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python)).

The rest of this repo - for instance the [the provisioning code that runs on devices themselves](../provisioning_client) for deploying code to devices - continues to be under active development.  This ending of new features only applies to code under this subfolder.
