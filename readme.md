# Azure IoT C SDKs and Libraries

[![Build Status](https://azure-iot-sdks.visualstudio.com/azure-iot-sdks/_apis/build/status/c/integrate-into-repo-C)](https://azure-iot-sdks.visualstudio.com/azure-iot-sdks/_build/latest?definitionId=85)


The Azure IOT Hub Device SDK allows applications written in C99 or later or C++ to communicate easily with [Azure IoT Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-hub/), [Azure IoT Central][Azure-IoT-Central] and to
 [Azure IoT Device Provisioning][Azure-IoT-Device-Provisioning].  This repo includes the source code for the libraries, setup instructions, and samples demonstrating use scenarios.

For constained devices - where memory is measured in kilobytes and not megabytes - there are even lighter weight SDK options available.  See [Other Azure IoT SDKs](#other-azure-iot-sdks) for more.

## Critical Upcoming Change Notice

All Azure IoT SDK users are advised to be aware of upcoming TLS certificate changes for Azure IoT Hub and Device Provisioning Service
that will impact the SDK's ability to connect to these services. In October 2022, both services will migrate from the current
[Baltimore CyberTrust CA Root](https://baltimore-cybertrust-root.chain-demos.digicert.com/info/index.html) to the
[DigiCert Global G2 CA root](https://global-root-g2.chain-demos.digicert.com/info/index.html). There will be a
transition period beforehand where your IoT devices must have both the Baltimore and Digicert public certificates
which may be hardcoded in their application or flashed onto your WiFi module in order to prevent connectivity issues.

**Devices with only the Baltimore public certificate will lose the ability to connect to Azure IoT Hub and Device Provisioning Service in October 2022.**

To prepare for this change, make sure your device's TLS stack has both of these public root of trust certificates configured.

For a more in depth explanation as to why the IoT services are doing this, please see
[this article](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/internet-of-things/azure-iot-tls-critical-changes-are-almost-here-and-why-you/ba-p/2393169).

## Getting the SDK
  The simplest way to get started with the Azure IoT SDKs on supported platforms is to use the following packages and libraries:
  * mbed:                                      [Device SDK library on MBED](./iothub_client/readme.md#mbed)
  * Arduino:                                   [Device SDK library in the Arduino IDE](./iothub_client/readme.md#arduino)
  * Windows:                                   [Device SDK on Vcpkg](./doc/setting_up_vcpkg.md#setup-c-sdk-vcpkg-for-windows-development-environment)
  * iOS:                                       [Device SDK on CocoaPod](https://cocoapods.org/pods/AzureIoTHubClient)

For other platforms - including Linux - you need to clone and build the SDK directly.  You may also build it directly for the platforms above.  Instructions can be found [here](./iothub_client/readme.md#compile).

## Samples
There are many samples available for the SDK.  More information can be found [here](./samples/readme.md).

## SDK API Reference Documentation

The API reference documentation for the C SDKs can be found [here][c-api-reference].

## Other Azure IoT SDKs

To find Azure IoT SDKs in other languages, please refer to the [guidance here][about-iot-sdks].

**Note on constrained devices**: The `Embedded C SDK` is an alternative for constrained devices which enables the BYO (bring your own) network approach: IoT developers have the freedom of choice to bring an MQTT client, TLS and Socket of their choice to create a device solution. Find more information about the Embedded C SDK [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c/tree/master/sdk/docs/iot).

To learn more about building Azure IoT Applications, you can visit the [Azure IoT Dev Center][iot-dev-center].

## Key Features

### Device Client SDK

IoT Hub supports multiple protocols for the device to connect with : MQTT, AMQP, and HTTPS.  MQTT and AMQP can optionally run over WebSockets.  The Device Client SDK allows the protocol to be chosen at connection creation time.

**If you're not sure which protocol to use, you should use MQTT or MQTT-WS.**  MQTT requires considerably fewer resources than AMQP and supports considerably more IoT Hub functionality than HTTPS.  Neither AMQP nor HTTPS are guaranteed to have Device Client SDK implementations for new features going forward, such as Azure IoT Plug and Play.

## OS Platforms and Hardware Compatibility

The IoT Hub device SDK for C can be used with a broad range of OS platforms and devices.

The minimum requirements are for the device platform to support the following:

- **Support Azure IoT TLS over TCP/IP Requirements**: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-tls-support
- **Support SHA-256** (optional): necessary to generate the secure token for authenticating the device with the service. Different authentication methods are available and not all require SHA-256.
- **Have a Real Time Clock or implement code to connect to an NTP server**: necessary for both establishing the TLS connection and generating the secure token for authentication.
- **Having at least 64KB of RAM**: the memory footprint of the SDK depends on the SDK and protocol used as well as the platform targeted. The smallest footprint is achieved targeting microcontrollers.

Platform support details can be found in [this document](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-device-sdk-platform-support).
You can find an exhaustive list of the OS platforms the various SDKs have been tested against in the [Azure Certified for IoT device catalog](https://catalog.azureiotsuite.com/). Note that you might still be able to use the SDKs on OS and hardware platforms that are not listed on this page: all the SDKs are open sourced and designed to be portable. If you have suggestions, feedback or issues to report, refer to the Contribution and Support sections below.

## Porting the Azure IoT Device Client SDK for C to New Devices

The C SDKs and Libraries:
* Are written in ANSI C (C99) and avoids compiler extensions to maximize code portability and broad platform compatibility.
* Expose a platform abstraction layer to isolate OS dependencies (threading and mutual exclusion mechanisms, communications protocol e.g. HTTP). Refer to our [porting guide][c-porting-guide] for more information about our abstraction layer.

In the repository you will find instructions and build tools to compile and run the device client SDK for C on Linux, Windows and microcontroller platforms (refer to the links above for more information on compiling the device client for C).

If you are considering porting the device client SDK for C to a new platform, check out the [porting guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-c-shared-utility/blob/master/devdoc/porting_guide.md) document.

# Long Term Support

The project offers a Long Term Support (LTS) version to allow users that do not need the latest features to be shielded from unwanted changes.

A new LTS version will be created every 6 months. The lifetime of an LTS branch is currently planned for one year. LTS branches receive all bug fixes that fall in one of these categories:

- security bugfixes
- critical bugfixes

No new features will be picked up in an LTS branch.

LTS branches are named lts_*mm*_*yyyy*, where *mm* and *yyyy* are the month and year when the branch was created. An example of such a branch is *lts_07_2017*.

## Schedule

Below is a table showing the mapping of the LTS branches to the packages released

  | Package | Github Branch | LTS Tag | LTS Start Date | Maintenance End Date |
  | :-----: | :-----------: | :-----: | :------------: | :------------------: |
  | VcPkg: 2021-09-09 | lts_07_2021 | LTS_07_2021_Ref01 | 2021-08-11 | 2022-08-11 |
  | Vcpkg: 2021-01-21 | lts_01_2021 | LTS_01_2021_Ref01 | 2021-01-21 | 2022-01-21 |
