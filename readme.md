# Azure IoT C SDKs and Libraries

[![Build Status](https://azure-iot-sdks.visualstudio.com/azure-iot-sdks/_apis/build/status/c/integrate-into-repo-C)](https://azure-iot-sdks.visualstudio.com/azure-iot-sdks/_build/latest?definitionId=85)

This repository contains the following:
* **Azure IoT Hub Device C SDK** to connect devices running C code to Azure IoT Hub.
* **Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service Client SDK** for enrolling devices with [Azure IoT Device Provisioning Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-dps/) and managing enrollments lists.
* **Azure IoT Hub Service C SDK** to interface with an Azure IoT Hub service instance from a server-side C application.
* **Serializer Library for C** to help serialize and deserialize data on your device.

## Packages and Libraries
  The simplest way to get started with the Azure IoT SDKs is to use the following packages and libraries:
  * Linux: [Device SDK on apt-get](./iothub_client/readme.md#aptgetpackage)
  * mbed:                                      [Device SDK library on MBED](./iothub_client/readme.md#mbed)
  * Arduino:                                   [Device SDK library in the Arduino IDE](./iothub_client/readme.md#arduino)
  * Windows:                                   [Device SDK on NuGet](./iothub_client/readme.md#nugetpackage)
  * iOS:                                       [Device SDK on CocoaPod](https://cocoapods.org/pods/AzureIoTHubClient)

## Samples
  Here are a set of simple samples that will help you get started:
  * [Device SDK Samples](./iothub_client/samples/)
  * [Service SDK Samples](./iothub_service_client/samples/)
  * [Serializer Library Samples](./serializer/samples/)

## Compile the SDK

When no package or library is available for your platform or if you want to modify the SDK code, or port the SDK to a new platform, then you can leverage the build environment provided in the repository.
  * [Device SDK](./iothub_client/readme.md#compile)
  * [Service SDK](./iothub_service_client/readme.md#compile)

## SDK API Reference Documentation

The IoT Hub device SDK for C can be used with a broad range of OS platforms and devices.

The minimum requirements are for the device platform to support the following:

- **Being capable of establishing an IP connection**: only IP-capable devices can communicate directly with Azure IoT Hub.
- **Support TLS**: required to establish a secure communication channel with Azure IoT Hub.
- **Support SHA-256** (optional): necessary to generate the secure token for authenticating the device with the service. Different authentication methods are available and not all require SHA-256.
- **Have a Real Time Clock or implement code to connect to an NTP server**: necessary for both establishing the TLS connection and generating the secure token for authentication.
- **Having at least 64KB of RAM**: the memory footprint of the SDK depends on the SDK and protocol used as well as the platform targeted. The smallest footprint is achieved targeting microcontrollers.

Platform support details can be found in [this document](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-device-sdk-platform-support).
You can find an exhaustive list of the OS platforms the various SDKs have been tested against in the [Azure Certified for IoT device catalog](https://catalog.azureiotsuite.com/). Note that you might still be able to use the SDKs on OS and hardware platforms that are not listed on this page: all the SDKs are open sourced and designed to be portable. If you have suggestions, feedback or issues to report, refer to the Contribution and Support sections below.

## Porting the Azure IoT Device Client SDK for C to New Devices

The C SDKs and Libraries:
* Are written in ANSI C (C99) and avoids compiler extensions to maximize code portability and broad platform compatibility.
* Expose a platform abstraction layer to isolate OS dependencies (threading and mutual exclusion mechanisms, communications protocol e.g. HTTP). Refer to our [porting guide][c-porting-guide] for more information about our abstraction layer.

In the repository you will find instructions and build tools to compile and run the device client SDK for C on Linux, Windows and microcontroller platforms (refer to the links above for more information on compiling the device client for C).

If you are considering porting the device client SDK for C to a new platform, check out the [porting guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-c-shared-utility/blob/master/devdoc/porting_guide.md) document.

## SDK Folder Structure

### /c-utility, /uamqp, /umqtt, /parson

These are git submodules that contain code, such as adapters and protocol implementations, shared with other projects. Note that some of them contain nested submodules.

### /blob

This folder contains client components that enable access to Azure blob storage.

### /dps_client

This folder contains client library for device provisioning service.

### /certs

Contains certificates needed to communicate with Azure IoT Hub.

### /doc

This folder contains application development guides and device setup instructions.

### /build_all

This folder contains platform-specific build scripts for the client libraries and dependent components.

### /iothub_client

Contains Azure IoT Hub client components that provide the raw messaging capabilities of the library. Refer to the API documentation and samples for information on how to use it.

   * build: has one subfolder for each platform (e.g. Windows, Linux, Mbed). Contains makefiles, batch files, and solutions that are used to generate the library binaries.
   * devdoc: contains requirements, designs notes, manuals.
   * inc: public include files.
   * src: client libraries source files.
   * samples: contains simple samples.
   * tests: unit and end-to-end tests for source code.

### /serializer

Contains libraries that provide modeling and JSON serialization capabilities on top of the raw messaging library. These libraries facilitate uploading structured data and command and control for use with Azure IoT services. Refer to the API documentation and samples for information on how to use it.

   * build: has one subfolder for each platform (e.g. Windows, Linux, Mbed). Contains makefiles, batch files, and solutions that are used to generate the library binaries.
   * devdoc: contains requirements, designs notes, manuals.
   * inc: public include files.
   * src: client libraries source files.
   * samples: contains simple samples.
   * tests: unit tests and end-to-end tests for source code.

### /iothub_service_client

Contains libraries that enable interactions with the IoT Hub service to perform operations such as sending messages to devices and managing the device identity registry.

### /testtools

Contains tools that are currently used in testing the client libraries: Mocking Framework (micromock), Generic Test Runner (CTest), Unit Test Project Template, etc.

### /tools

Miscellaneous tools: compilembed, mbed_build, traceabilitytool (checks spec requirements vs code implementation).

# Long Term Support

The project offers a Long Term Support (LTS) version to allow users that do not need the latest features to be shielded from unwanted changes.

A new LTS version will be created every 6 months. The lifetime of an LTS branch is currently planned for one year. LTS branches receive all bug fixes that fall in one of these categories:

- security bugfixes
- critical bugfixes

No new features will be picked up in an LTS branch.

LTS branches are named lts_*mm*_*yyyy*, where *mm* and *yyyy* are the month and year when the branch was created. An example of such a branch is *lts_07_2017*.
