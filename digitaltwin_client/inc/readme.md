# Digital Twin Client header files

This folder contains the public and internal header files for the Digital Twin Client for the C SDK.

## Do not use the internal folder
The [internal](./internal) folder is only intended for building the Digital Twin SDK itself.  Its contents are not for public consumption and the headers may change without notice.  Your application code should not include any internal header directly.
