IoT Plug and Play has evolved since the public preview released on Aug 2019. As a result, some services and APIs are no longer applicable and have been retired because IoT Plug and Play reached the General Availability Milestone.

You can read more about the latest updates in the blog post announcement https://aka.ms/iotblog/iotplugandplay.  For code and instructions for creating a PnP device using the Azure IoT C SDK, see [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/tree/master/iothub_client/samples/pnp).

An archived copy of the source code in this branch is available under the git tag `public-preview-pnp-2020-06`.  The service will not support this long-term however and you should migrate to the GA mechanism.
