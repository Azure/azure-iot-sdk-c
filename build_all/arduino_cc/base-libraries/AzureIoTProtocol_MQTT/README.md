# AzureIoTProtocol_MQTT - Azure IoT MQTT protocol library for Arduino

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/arduino-libraries/AzureIoTProtocol_MQTT.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/arduino-libraries/AzureIoTProtocol_MQTT)

This library is a port of the compact implementation of the MQTT protocol from [Microsoft Azure IoT device SDK for C](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/c/readme.md) to Arduino. Together with the AzureIoTHub, it allows you to use several Arduino compatible boards with Azure IoT Hub. Please submit any contribution directly to [azure-iot-sdks](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks).

Currently supported hardware:
- Atmel SAMD Based boards
  - Arduino/Genuino [MKR1000](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoMKR1000)
  - Arduino/Genuino [Zero](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardZero) and [WiFi Shield 101](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoWiFiShield101) 
  - Adafruit [Feather M0](https://www.adafruit.com/products/3010)
- ESP8266 based boards with [esp8266/arduino](https://github.com/esp8266/arduino)
  - SparkFun [Thing](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13711)
  - Adafruit [Feather Huzzah](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2821)

## Prerequisites

-   [Arduino IDE 1.6.8](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
-   Install the `AzureIoTHub` library via the Arduino IDE Library Manager
-   Install the `AzureIoTUtility` library via the Arduino IDE Library Manager
-   Install the `AzureIoTProtocol_MQTT` library via the Arduino IDE Library Manager

2. Install the `WiFi101` library from the Arduino IDE Library Manager.
3. Install the `NTPClient` library from the Arduino IDE Library Manager.
4. Install the `RTCZero` library from the Arduino IDE Library Manager.
5. Update Wifi SSID/Password in simplesample_mqtt.ino 
    * Ensure you are using a wifi network that does not require additional manual steps after connection, such as opening a web browser.
6. Update IoT Hub Connection string in simplesample_mqtt.c

## ESP8266
##### Sparkfun Thing, Adafruit Feather Huzzah, or generic ESP8266 board
