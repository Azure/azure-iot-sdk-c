4. Include enough information for us to address the bug:

   -  A detailed description.
   -  A Minimal Complete Reproducible Example (https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve). This is code we can cut and paste into a readily available sample and run, or a link to a project you've written that we can compile to reproduce the bug. 
   -  Console logs. If you are unsure how to enable logging, refer to this document: https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/blob/master/doc/Iothub_sdk_options.md

**Development Machine, OS, Compiler (and Other Relevant Toolchain Info)**

Raspberry Pi, Raspbian Stretch Lite (Release 2018-11-13)
Cross Compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 using GCC 6.3.0

**SDK Version (Please Give Commit SHA if Manually Compiling)**

Release 2019-01-31

**Protocol**

MQTT

**Describe the Bug**

If MQTT is unable to establish a connection, it will keep trying and once it succeeds queued messages will be sent to the Cloud. However, if for some reason we can't get past the initial connection phase, then SDK does not respect message timeouts. 

**[MCVE](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve)**

```
#include "iothub.h"

int main(void)
{
    if (lightbulb == ON) {
        iothub_say_hello();
        return 0;
    } else {
        iothub_say_goodbye();
        return 1;
    }
}
```
