# Azure IoT Plug and Play Simple Thermostat sample

This directory contains a sample thermostat that implements the model [dtmi:com:example:Thermostat;1](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v2/samples/Thermostat.json).  

This sample is relatively straightforward, only implementing telemetry, properties, and commands *without* using sub-components.  Compare this to the more complex [pnp_temperature_controller](../pnp_temperature_controller).

## Configuring the sample

See [../readme.md](../readme.md) for how to configure this sample.
